#### **Auto Summarization**

- **Auto Summarization** in EIGRP automatically summarizes routes at classful network boundaries, reducing the routing table size by merging multiple subnets into a single classful network address.
- However, enabling auto summarization can lead to suboptimal routing if networks are disjointed.
- **Example**: Consider two subnets, **192.168.1.0/24** and **192.168.2.0/24**, connected through different routers. If auto-summary is enabled, both subnets might be summarized as **192.168.0.0/16** when advertised. This can cause incorrect routing as the routers may treat both subnets as part of the same network, resulting in incorrect forwarding, routing loops, or traffic being directed to the wrong destination.
- To enable auto-summary: `auto-summary` (enabled by default). To disable it: `no auto-summary`.

#### **Bandwidth Management**

- **Bandwidth management** in EIGRP is important to ensure routing updates donâ€™t consume excessive network bandwidth.
- EIGRP allows you to control the bandwidth percentage used for routing updates with the **"Bandwidth Percent"** feature, which limits the percentage of available bandwidth an interface can use for EIGRP updates.
- By default, EIGRP uses up to 50% of the interface bandwidth.

##### **Drawbacks**:

1. **Over-utilization**: On low-bandwidth links, using 50% can lead to congestion for other traffic.
2. **Under-utilization**: On high-bandwidth links, it might not fully utilize available bandwidth, potentially slowing down routing convergence.
3. **Inaccurate Bandwidth Setting**: Misconfigured bandwidth settings can cause EIGRP to use too much or too little bandwidth, degrading performance.

#### **EIGRP Algorithm: DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm)**

- EIGRP uses the **DUAL** algorithm for calculating the best paths. Routes are identified by the letter **D**, which stands for DUAL.

#### **Common Commands**:

- `router eigrp <AS-Number>`
- `network <Network>`
- `show ip eigrp topology`
- `show ip eigrp neighbor`
- `show ip route`
