**VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)** is a Cisco proprietary protocol developed by Cisco Systems.

**Definition & Purpose:** VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) is used to manage VLAN configuration across switches in a network. It allows for the centralized administration of VLANs, ensuring consistency across multiple devices. VTP operates over trunk links, which carry traffic from multiple VLANs.

- **Trunk Port**: A port that carries traffic for multiple VLANs. It is used to connect switches or devices that need to communicate across multiple VLANs.
    
- **Trunk Link**: The physical link that connects trunk ports and is responsible for carrying VLAN-tagged traffic between switches.
    
- **Access Port**: A port that belongs to a single VLAN and is used to connect end devices like computers and printers.
    
- **Trunks**: Trunks are essential for allowing communication between devices in different VLANs over a single link. They are commonly used to connect switches and allow traffic from multiple VLANs to flow between them.
    
- **VLAN ID Header**: When packets travel over a trunk, a VLAN ID header is added to the packet to indicate which VLAN the packet belongs to. This header helps devices on the receiving end to correctly process the traffic.
    
- **Tagging Methods**: There are two common methods for tagging VLAN IDs on trunk links:
    
    - **ISL (Inter-Switch Link)**: A Cisco proprietary protocol for tagging VLAN information.
    - **802.1Q**: The industry-standard method for VLAN tagging.

### **Configuring a Trunk Link**

The following steps configure a trunk link. Note that the 2900 series switches only support 802.1Q and do not support ISL.

1. Enter interface configuration mode for the desired port:  
    `switch(config)# int g0/0`
    
2. Set the port mode to trunk:  
    `switch(config)# switchport mode trunk`
    
3. Choose the encapsulation method (either ISL or 802.1Q):
    
    - For ISL:  
        `switch(config)# switchport trunk encapsulation isl`
    - For 802.1Q:  
        `switch(config)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`

### **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)** Configuration**

VTP operates over trunk links and allows for the distribution of VLAN information between switches.

1. Set the VTP domain name:  
    `switch(config)# vtp domain <Name>`
    
2. Configure the VTP mode:
    
    - To allow the switch to create and modify VLANs:  
        `switch(config)# vtp mode server`
    - To allow the switch to only read VLAN information:  
        `switch(config)# vtp mode client`
    - To disable VTP and configure VLANs manually:  
        `switch(config)# vtp mode transparent`
3. (Optional) Set a VTP password for security:  
    `switch(config)# password <password>`
