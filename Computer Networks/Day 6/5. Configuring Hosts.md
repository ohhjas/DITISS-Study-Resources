### **Static IP Host Mapping**:

**Static** host configuration allows you to assign names to IP addresses, making it easier to telnet to those routers by name rather than using IPs.
- **Command**:
    `A(config)# ip host B 172.16.20.2 `
    `A(config)# ip host C 170.16.40.2`
- **Explanation**:
    - This command maps the name (e.g., B, C) to the respective IP address (e.g., 172.16.20.2).
    - **Limitations**: You can configure up to **8 static hosts** using this method.
    - This is useful to remember the IPs of frequently accessed routers.

### **Dynamic IP Host Mapping Using DNS**

Dynamic IP host mapping allows routers to use a DNS server to resolve hostnames to IP addresses, eliminating the need for manual configuration on hosts.

##### **Default Behavior**

By default, most modern network devices have DNS resolution enabled (e.g., the `ip domain-lookup` command in IOS 11.3+).

**Problem:**

- If a DNS server is not configured, mistyping a command or hostname can cause the device to repeatedly broadcast and attempt to resolve the name to `255.255.255.255` (broadcast address), leading to delays.

**Solution:**

- Disable DNS lookups if a DNS server is not configured to prevent unnecessary broadcast attempts:
    
    ```
    A(config)# no ip domain-lookup  
    ```
    
##### **Configuring DNS**

1. **Specify the DNS Server IP Address:**  
    Set the IP address of the DNS server that the device will use for name resolution:
    
    ```
    A(config)# ip name-server <DNS_Server_IP>  
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    A(config)# ip name-server 172.16.50.100  
    ```
    
2. **Name Resolution in Action:**
    
    - When a hostname (e.g., `b.sunbeam.com`) is entered:
        - The device sends a DNS query to the configured server.
        - If the DNS server resolves the hostname, the device uses the returned IP address to connect.
    
    **Example Usage:**
    
    ```
    A# b.sunbeam.com  
    ```
    
    - The device queries the DNS server and establishes a connection once the IP address is resolved.
##### **Domain Name Shortcuts**

To simplify hostname entries, you can configure a default domain name:

```
A(config)# ip domain-name <domain_name>  
```

**Example:**

```
A(config)# ip domain-name sunbeam.com  
```

After setting a default domain name, you can use shortcuts for DNS lookups. Instead of typing the full hostname, you can just use the hostname:

```
A# b  
```

The device appends the default domain (`sunbeam.com`) to the hostname (`b`), automatically resolving it to `b.sunbeam.com`.

### **Summary**:

- **Static**: Use `ip host` to manually configure up to 8 hostnames with their IP addresses.
- **Dynamic**: Use a **DNS server** to dynamically resolve hostnames to IPs using `ip name-server` and domain name configuration.
- To avoid unnecessary DNS lookups when DNS is not configured, use `no ip domain-lookup`.
