### **Configuration Register Values**:

1. **0x2142**:
    
    - Bypasses the **NVRAM startup configuration** during the boot process.
    - This is typically used for password recovery or when you want to boot the device without applying the saved configuration.
2. **0x2100**:
    
    - Boots the device into **ROMMON mode** (ROM Monitor mode).
    - This is used for troubleshooting, firmware recovery, or manual boot configuration.
3. **0x2101**:
    
    - Boots the device into **Mini IOS** (also known as RXBOOT mode or Bootstrap mode).
    - This mode provides a minimal IOS image, often used for diagnostics or basic operations.
4. **0x2102 to 0x210F**:
    
    - Boots the device normally using the **NVRAM startup configuration**.
    - **0x2102** is the default configuration register value for most devices, ensuring a normal boot sequence.

### Notes:

- **Configuration register values** are stored in the router's NVRAM and can be modified using the `config-register` command in global configuration mode.
- These values directly influence how the router behaves during boot-up, particularly in terms of where it looks for the IOS image and configuration files.

### **Password Recovery Procedure**:

1. Power on the router and connect via the console.
2. Press **Ctrl + Break** to interrupt the boot sequence, entering **ROMMON mode** (or mini IOS).
3. Enter commands to change the configuration register to bypass NVRAM:
    - **800 series**: `set iso-conf-0x2142`
    - **2500 series**: `o/r 0x2142`
    - **2600 series**: `confreg 0x2142`
4. Restart the router.
5. After reboot, when prompted for setup, select **No**.
6. Enter **Router>** mode, and type `enable` to enter **Router#** mode.
7. Run `A#copy start run` to copy the startup configuration to the running configuration.
8. Enter configuration mode with `A#conf t`.
9. Change the password with `A(config)#enable secret <newpassword>`.
10. Reset the configuration register with `A(config)#config-reg 0x2102`.
11. Exit configuration mode with `A#exit`.
12. Finally, save the running configuration with `A#copy run start`.
