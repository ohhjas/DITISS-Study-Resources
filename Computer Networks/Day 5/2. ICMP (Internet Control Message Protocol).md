**ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**  
ICMP is a network protocol used by IP networks to send error messages and control information, such as status updates. Common utilities like **Ping** and **Traceroute** rely on ICMP for network troubleshooting.

- **Ping**: Sends ICMP **Echo Request** messages to a target device to check connectivity. If the target is reachable, it responds with an **Echo Reply**.
- **Traceroute**: Traces the route packets take through a network to reach a target device by sending multiple ICMP **Echo Requests** with varying **TTL (Time-To-Live)** values.

**Traceroute Command**

- **Windows**: Use `tracert` in the command prompt.
- **Linux/Mac**: Use `traceroute` in the terminal.

**How Traceroute Works**

1. Traceroute sends packets with incrementally increasing **TTL** values, starting from 1.
2. Each router (or hop) that processes the packet decrements the **TTL** by 1.
    - If the **TTL** reaches 0, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP **Time Exceeded** message back to the source.
3. By analyzing the source IP address of each returned ICMP message, Traceroute identifies each hop along the path to the destination.

### Additional Details

- **TTL**: Starts at a high value (e.g., 255) and decreases with each hop. This mechanism prevents packets from circulating indefinitely in a network.
- The final destination responds with an ICMP **Echo Reply**, indicating the route is fully traced.
