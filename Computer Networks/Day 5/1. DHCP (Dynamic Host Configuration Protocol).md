Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol that automates the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration details to devices (clients) on a network. This eliminates the need for manual configuration of IP settings.

### **Key Concepts in DHCP**

#### **Lease Duration**

- The DHCP server assigns IP addresses to devices for a specific period called the _lease duration_.
- If a device disconnects from the network shortly after receiving an IP address, the lease doesn’t automatically remain active for the full duration (e.g., three days).
- The server can reclaim and reassign the unused IP address based on network policies or usage. This ensures efficient IP address allocation.

#### **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)**

- APIPA is a fallback mechanism used when a DHCP server fails or cannot be reached.
- Devices, primarily Windows systems, assign themselves an IP address in the range **169.254.x.x** to maintain local network communication.
- While this allows devices to communicate within the local network, they cannot access external networks (e.g., the internet).
- Example: In the early 2000s, a DHCP server failure led to devices discarding their IP addresses, causing external network connectivity loss. However, local communication was preserved through APIPA.

#### **Unicast and Broadcast Requests**

- Devices initially send **unicast requests** to renew their IP leases before the lease time reaches **87.5%** of its duration.
- If the DHCP server doesn’t respond, the device switches to **broadcasting requests**.
- If the server still doesn’t reply, devices self-assign an IP address from the APIPA range, as seen in systems like Windows 98 and later.

## **Tree Architecture**

Tree architecture plays a significant role in how **transport layer protocols** (e.g., TCP and UDP) function in network configurations.

- **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for applications requiring error correction (e.g., file transfers).
- **UDP**: Connectionless protocol used for speed-critical tasks (e.g., video streaming).  
    Understanding tree-based structures helps in designing networks and selecting appropriate transport layer protocols for specific tasks.

## **IP Address Structure**

An IP address consists of two primary parts:

1. **Network Part**: Identifies the specific network to which the device belongs.
2. **Host Part**: Identifies the specific device within that network.

### **Supporting Protocols**

1. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
    - Translates an IP address into a MAC address for local network communication.
2. **RARP (Reverse ARP)**
    - Maps a device’s MAC address to an IP address, typically during the device’s boot process when it doesn’t know its own IP.
3. **BootP (Bootstrap Protocol)**
    - A precursor to DHCP, BootP assigns IP addresses and provides basic configuration details to devices.
4. **Proxy ARP**
    - Enables a router to reply to ARP requests on behalf of another device, helping devices send packets to a router without knowing its specific IP.
