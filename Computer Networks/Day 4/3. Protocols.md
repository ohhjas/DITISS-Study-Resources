#### **HTTP/HTTPS**

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Port 80, used for transferring web data.
- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** Port 443, encrypted communication for security.

#### **FTP/TFTP**

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Reliable, uses TCP, allows directory browsing, and requires authentication. Typically uses **port 21** for command/control and **port 20** for data transfer.
- **TFTP (Trivial FTP):** Fast but less secure, uses UDP, and does not require authentication. Uses **port 69**.

#### **SMTP, POP3, IMAP**

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used to send emails (push protocol).
- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol):** Retrieves emails (pull protocol).
- **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Combines both push and pull functionalities and is optimized for modern email services.

#### **Telnet**

- A protocol used to remotely access network devices over a command-line interface. Itâ€™s less secure compared to modern alternatives like **SSH**. Telnet uses **port 23** while SSH uses **port 22**.

#### **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**

- Used for network management and monitoring. It collects information via **traps** and **alerts**, which help administrators manage network performance.
- Typically uses **port 161** for **SNMP messages** and **port 162** for **SNMP trap messages**.

#### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

- Resolves domain names to IP addresses. Uses both **UDP** (for faster lookups) and **TCP** (for reliability when necessary).
- Uses **port 53**.

#### **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network. DHCP assigns:
    - IP address
    - Subnet mask
    - Default gateway
    - DNS server addresses
- **Port 67**: This is the **server port** used by the DHCP server to listen for client requests.
- **Port 68**: This is the **client port** used by DHCP clients to send requests to the server.
