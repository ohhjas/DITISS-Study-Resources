**Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a networking technique that converts **private IP addresses** (non-routable on the public internet) into **public IP addresses** (routable), and vice versa. This enables devices within a private network to communicate with external networks, such as the internet, by utilizing a public IP address.

### Types of NAT:

1. **Static NAT**: Provides a one-to-one mapping between private and public IP addresses.
2. **Dynamic NAT**: Dynamically assigns a public IP address from a pool of available addresses to private IPs as needed.
3. **Dynamic NAT with Overload (PAT)**: Also known as Port Address Translation, this method allows multiple private IP addresses to share a single public IP by differentiating traffic using unique port numbers.
