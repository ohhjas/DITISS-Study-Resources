### **Overview**

- **Address Size:**  
    IPv6 addresses are **128 bits long (16 bytes)**, compared to IPv4 addresses, which are only **32 bits (4 bytes)**. This provides a much larger address space.
    
- **Representation:**  
    IPv6 addresses are written in **hexadecimal** (base-16) format, making it easier to represent the longer addresses in a compact way.

### **Examples of IPv6 Addresses**

1. **Full Notation:**  
    `003A:2B1C:0000:0000:0009:0101:0000:007C /64`  
    (All groups of zeros are written explicitly.)
    
2. **Compressed Notation:**  
    `3A:2B1C:0:0:9:101:0:7C /64`  
    (Leading zeros in each group can be removed.)
    
3. **Using Double Colon (::):**  
    `3A:2B1C::9:101:0:7C /64`  
    (The `::` replaces **consecutive groups of zeros** to shorten the address.)
    
4. **Another Variation:**  
    `3A:2B1C:0:0:9:101::7C /64`  
    (The `::` can only be used **once per address** to avoid confusion.)

### **Structure of IPv6 Addresses**

1. **Network Part (First 64 Bits):**
    
    - This part identifies the specific network.
    - Example: In `3A:2B1C::/64`, the **`3A:2B1C`** is the network prefix.
2. **Host Part (Last 64 Bits):**
    
    - This part identifies individual devices (hosts) within the network.
    - Example: In `3A:2B1C:0:0:9:101:0:7C`, the **`0:0:9:101:0:7C`** is the host portion.

---

### **Important Notes**

- The **Double Colon (::)** simplifies addresses by replacing consecutive zeros.
    - Example: `3A:2B1C:0:0:0:0:0:1` can be written as `3A:2B1C::1`.
- **Limitation:** The `::` can be used only **once** in a single IPv6 address to avoid ambiguity.

### **Benefits of IPv6**

- **Massive Address Space:** IPv6 supports a vast number of addresses, solving IPv4's exhaustion problem.
- **Simplified Network Management:** Its structure makes it easier to identify and manage networks.

### **Configuring IPv6**

1. **Enable IPv6 Routing:**
    
    - Command: `ipv6 unicast-routing`
2. **Access the Interface:**
    
    - Command: `int g0/0`  
        (Enter configuration mode for the Gigabit Ethernet interface 0/0.)
3. **Assign an IPv6 Address Using EUI-64:**
    
    - Command: `ipv6 address 3A:2B1C::/64 eui-64`  
        (Generates the address automatically based on the interfaceâ€™s MAC address.)
4. **Manually Assign a Specific IPv6 Address:**
    
    - Command: `ipv6 address 3A:2B1C::1/64`  
        (Manually assigns the first IP in the network to the interface.)
