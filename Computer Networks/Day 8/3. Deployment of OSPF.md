### Scenario:

- **Router 1 (R1)**: IP 172.16.20.1
- **Router 2 (R2)**: IP 172.16.20.2
- **Directly connected** via a single link.

### Steps:

1. **Activate OSPF**: R1 and R2 enable OSPF on their interfaces.
    
2. **Send Hello Packets**: Both routers send Hello packets to the multicast address 224.0.0.5 to discover each other.
    
3. **Form Neighbor Relationship**: They exchange Hello packets and become OSPF neighbors if OSPF settings match (e.g., area ID).
    
4. **Exchange LSAs**: Routers exchange Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) to share information about their networks.
    
5. **Build Link-State Database (LSDB)**: Both routers create an identical database containing network topology information.
    
6. **Calculate Best Routes**: Using the Dijkstra algorithm, each router calculates the shortest path to each network.
    
7. **Update Routing Tables**: Routers update their routing tables with the best routes and start forwarding packets.

R.ID (Router ID): it is the highest of the physical interfaces.

### **Stages:**

	Down
	|
	Init / Attempt (sending hellos)
	|
	Two Way (reply hellos)
	|
	Exchange-State (Master/Slave)
	|
	Exchange (DD)
	|
	Loading (Query)
	|
	Full

1. **Down**:
    
    - This is the initial state where no OSPF packets have been exchanged between routers.
    - The router is unaware of its neighbors.
2. **Init / Attempt**:
    
    - **Init**: The router has sent a **Hello packet** to its neighbors but has not yet received any Hello in response.
    - **Attempt** (used only in NBMA networks): The router actively tries to establish communication with a neighbor by sending Hello packets to a specific neighbor.
3. **Two-Way**:
    
    - The router has received a **Hello packet** from a neighbor and recognized its own router ID in the packet.
    - A bidirectional communication is established.
    - The OSPF **DR/BDR election** occurs in this state for broadcast or multi-access networks.
4. **Exchange-State**:
    
    - The router and its neighbor establish a **master-slave relationship** to synchronize their databases.
    - The router with the higher Router ID becomes the **master** and starts the database synchronization.
5. **Exchange**:
    
    - The routers exchange **Database Description (DD) packets**, which contain summaries of the link-state database (LSDB).
    - This allows each router to compare its database with its neighbor's.
6. **Loading**:
    
    - The routers send **Link State Request (LSR) packets** to request more detailed information about any missing or outdated LSAs (Link-State Advertisements) found during the exchange phase.
    - The neighbor responds with **Link State Update (LSU) packets**, which contain the requested LSAs.
7. **Full**:
    
    - The OSPF routers have synchronized their LSDBs and are now fully adjacent.
    - The neighbor relationship is established, and the routers can exchange routing information.

##### Explanation in Short:

- **Down**: No communication.
- **Init**: Sending Hello packets.
- **Two-Way**: Hello reply received; bidirectional communication established.
- **Ex-Start**: Master/Slave roles determined for database synchronization.
- **Exchange**: Summary of LSDBs (DD packets) exchanged.
- **Loading**: Missing information requested and updated.
- **Full**: LSDBs fully synchronized; neighbor relationship established.
