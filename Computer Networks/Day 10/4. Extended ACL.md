### **Extended ACL: Filtering Based on Multiple Parameters**

An **Extended Access Control List (ACL)** provides more flexibility than a standard ACL by allowing you to filter traffic based on **multiple parameters** such as source/destination IP addresses, protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), and port numbers. This is particularly useful when you need to control specific communication between devices within a network.

#### **Scenario 1: Blocking Communication Between Specific PCs**

Imagine you have two groups of PCs:

- **PC 1, 2, 3, ...** ---- **Router A** ---- **Router B** ---- **PC 10, 11, 12, ....**

In this case, **PC 1** (IP: `172.16.10.50`) should not be allowed to communicate with **PC 10** (IP: `172.16.30.50`), while all other devices should still be able to communicate with each other.

**Commands:**

1. **Block traffic between PC 1 and PC 10:**
    
    - `A(config)# access-list 110 deny ip host 172.16.10.50 host 172.16.30.50`
    - This command denies **PC 1** (`172.16.10.50`) from communicating with **PC 10** (`172.16.30.50`) using any protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP). To filter specific traffic types, replace `ip` with protocols such as `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`.
2. **Allow all other traffic:**
    
    - `A(config)# access-list 110 permit ip any any`
    - This command permits **all other traffic** between any source and any destination on the network.

**Key Points:**

- **Order matters**: ACLs are processed top to bottom. Therefore, always place the **deny** statement first and ensure there is at least one **permit** statement, otherwise, the implicit **deny all** at the end will block all traffic.
- If you only want to block specific types of traffic (e.g., TCP), you can replace `ip` with the relevant protocol (e.g., `TCP`).

---

#### **Scenario 2: Allowing Only Specific Traffic (FTP in this Case)**

Suppose you want to allow only **FTP traffic (TCP port 21)** into your network and block all other incoming traffic.

**Commands:**

1. **Allow FTP Traffic (Port 21):**
    
    - `A(config)# access-list 120 permit tcp any 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 21`
    - This command allows **only FTP traffic (TCP port 21)** from any source to the destination subnet `172.16.10.0/24`.
2. **Apply the ACL to the Interface:**
    
    - `A(config)# int g0/1`
    - `A(config-if)# ip access-group 120 in`
    - This applies the ACL to inbound traffic on the **GigabitEthernet 0/1** interface.

**Generalized ACL Command Format:**

```
A(config)# access-list <number> <permit/deny> <protocol> <source IP> <wildcard mask> <destination IP> <wildcard mask> eq <port>
```

- This setup allows **only FTP traffic** while blocking all other traffic due to the implicit **deny all** rule.
- **Efficiency Tip**: Place the most specific rules at the top of the ACL.

#### **Scenario 3: Restricting Access to Specific Hosts and Ports**

You have two networks:

- **172.16.10.0/24** (Network A)
- **172.16.30.0/24** (Network B)

You want to implement the following rules:

1. Allow all traffic between the two networks except for one specific host.
2. Only **HTTP traffic (port 80)** should be allowed to **172.16.30.100** from **172.16.10.0/24**.
3. Block all other types of traffic to **172.16.30.100**.

**Commands:**

1. **Allow only HTTP traffic to 172.16.30.100:**
    
    - `A(config)# access-list 120 permit tcp 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 host 172.16.30.100 eq 80`
    - This allows **only HTTP (TCP port 80)** traffic from **172.16.10.0/24** to **172.16.30.100**.
2. **Deny all other traffic to 172.16.30.100:**
    
    - `A(config)# access-list 120 deny ip any host 172.16.30.100`
    - This denies **all traffic** from any source to **172.16.30.100**, except HTTP.
3. **Allow all other traffic between the two networks:**
    
    - `A(config)# access-list 120 permit ip 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255 172.16.30.0 0.0.0.255`
    - This permits **any traffic** between **172.16.10.0/24** and **172.16.30.0/24** except the restricted traffic to **172.16.30.100**.
4. **Apply the ACL to the Interface (e.g., GigabitEthernet 0/1):**
    
    - `A(config)# int g0/1`
    - `A(config-if)# ip access-group 120 in`
    - This applies the ACL to inbound traffic on the interface `g0/1`.

### **Conclusion**

Using **extended ACLs**, you can create highly specific rules to control traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports, offering flexibility and security in managing network communication. Always ensure the correct order of rules and apply ACLs to the appropriate interfaces for effective filtering.
