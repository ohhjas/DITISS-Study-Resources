A **Standard ACL** filters traffic based solely on the **source IP address**, allowing or blocking traffic based on whether it matches a specified address.

**Commands:**

- `A(config)# access-list 10 permit 172.16.10.10 0.0.0.0`:  
    This command allows traffic from the exact IP address `172.16.10.10`. The wildcard mask `0.0.0.0` ensures that only this specific IP address is allowed.
    
- `A(config-if)# ip access-group 10 in` and `A(config-if)# ip access-group 10 out`:  
    These commands apply ACL 10 to the interface, controlling whether traffic coming **into** or going **out of** the interface is filtered.

### **Example: Blocking Specific IP Address**

To prevent the device with IP address `172.16.10.10` from communicating, while allowing all other devices, the following commands can be used:

1. `A(config)# access-list 10 deny 172.16.10.10 0.0.0.0`:  
    This denies traffic from the specific host `172.16.10.10`. You can also use `host 172.16.10.10` instead of `172.16.10.10 0.0.0.0` to achieve the same result.
    
2. `A(config)# access-list 10 permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`:  
    This command allows all other traffic. You can use `any` in place of `0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255` for simplicity.
    
3. `A(config)# int g0/0`:  
    Enter the interface configuration mode for the specific interface (e.g., `g0/0`).
    
4. `A(config-if)# ip access-group 10 in`:  
    Apply ACL 10 to filter incoming traffic.
    

**Important Note:**

- The **permit** command is necessary to ensure other traffic is allowed. Without the `permit` command, only denied traffic will be filtered, and no other traffic will be permitted.
- The order of the commands is critical. If the `permit` command is placed after the `deny` command, it ensures all traffic except `172.16.10.10` is allowed. Reversing the order would result in `172.16.10.10` being allowed due to the broader `permit` rule.
