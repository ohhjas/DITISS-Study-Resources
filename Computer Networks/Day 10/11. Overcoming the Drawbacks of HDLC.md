### Protocols in the Data Link Layer: Addressing HDLC Limitations

The **Data Link Layer** employs various protocols to overcome the limitations of **HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)**, with **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)** being a prominent example. PPP includes two critical components:

- **NCP (Network Control Protocol)**: A framework within PPP that enables multiple network layer protocols to function over a single point-to-point link. An example is **IPCP (Internet Protocol Control Protocol)**, used for configuring and managing IP connections.
    
- **LCP (Link Control Protocol)**: Responsible for establishing, configuring, and testing data link connections, LCP was particularly useful during the era of traditional telephone lines for data transmission.

### Key Features of LCP

1. **Multilink Support**  
    LCP allows multiple physical links to be combined into a single logical link. This feature was crucial in the era of PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), where typical telephone lines offered low speeds (e.g., 28.8 kbps).
    
2. **Error Detection**  
    Mechanisms like the **Quality metric** and **Magic Number** ensure data integrity during transmission, minimizing errors and avoiding link misidentification.
    
3. **Compression**  
    LCP improves data transfer rates through compression techniques, such as:
    
    - **Stacker**: Uses a dictionary-based method to reduce data size before transmission.
    - **Predictor**: Optimizes data transmission by predicting patterns in the data.
4. **Authentication**  
    LCP supports user authentication to enhance connection security, with two main protocols:
    
    - **PAP (Password Authentication Protocol)**:
        
        - Transmits username and password in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception.
        - Authentication occurs only once at the start of the session.
    - **CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol)**:
        
        - Employs a secure three-way handshake for authentication, occurring periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds) during the session.
            
        - Uses **MD5 hashing** for added security:
            
            1. **Challenge**: Router A sends a random challenge to Router B.
            2. **Response**: Router B combines the challenge with its password and sends the hashed result.
            3. **Verification**: Router A compares the received hash with its own calculation.
            
            Since the hash value changes with every challenge, CHAP provides robust protection against session hijacking and replay attacks.
