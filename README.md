# DITISS Study Resources

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository for **DITISS study materials**. This repo is where Iâ€™ve compiled all my notes, resources, and references from the **Post Graduate Diploma in IT Infrastructure, Systems & Security (PG-DITISS)** course at Sunbeam, Pune.

## What's Inside

Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™ve organized everything:

- **Compliance Audit**: Notes on compliance rules, audits, and how they apply to cybersecurity.
- **Computer Networks**: Basics and advanced topics, including routing, switching, and network protocols.
- **Operating Systems**: Linux and Windows notes, with admin tips and tricks.
- **Security Concepts**: Stuff on ethical hacking, web security, and a bit of Python for security tools.
- **Windows Administration**: Detailed guides on managing Windows servers, Active Directory, and group policies.
- **Case Studies**: Real-world scenarios and how we tackled them during the course.

## How to Use This Repo

Just browse through the folders and pick what you need. Each topic has its own folder, and Iâ€™ve tried to keep things clean and organized. If something looks messy, let me know. I'm learning too! ðŸ˜Š

## Why I Made This

This repo is mostly for my revision and to help out anyone else doing DITISS or similar courses. Sharing is caring, right?

## Got Suggestions?

If you spot errors, or think something can be explained better, feel free to contribute. Fork the repo, make your edits, and send me a pull request. Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback!
