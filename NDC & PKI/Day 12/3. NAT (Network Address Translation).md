- **Definition**: NAT is the method where the source or destination IP address and/or port number of a packet is modified as it travels through a router or firewall.
- **Purpose**:
    - To hide internal private IP addresses behind a public IP.
    - To allow multiple devices to share a single public IP address for accessing the internet.
    - To redirect traffic for specific services.

### **Types of NAT**

#### **SNAT vs. DNAT**

1. **Source NAT (SNAT)**:
   - **Function**: Modifies the source IP address in the packet.
   - **Use Case**: Common for outbound traffic from private networks to the internet.
   - **Example**: Changing a private IP (`192.168.1.10`) to a public IP (`203.0.113.1`).

2. **Destination NAT (DNAT)**:
   - **Function**: Modifies the destination IP address in the packet.
   - **Use Case**: Redirects inbound traffic to specific servers within a private network.
   - **Example**: Redirecting traffic from a public IP (`203.0.113.1`) on port `80` to a private IP (`192.168.1.20`).

#### **Static NAT vs. Dynamic NAT**

- **Static NAT**:
   - **Function**: Maps a single private IP to a single public IP.
   - **Characteristics**: The mapping is constant.
   - **Use Case**: Hosting servers or services that need consistent access.
   - **Example**: Server (`192.168.1.10`) always mapped to public IP (`203.0.113.10`).

- **Dynamic NAT**:
   - **Function**: Maps multiple private IPs to a pool of public IPs.
   - **Characteristics**: The mapping is dynamic.
   - **Use Case**: Situations with limited public IP addresses.
   - **Example**: Devices (`192.168.1.10`, `192.168.1.11`) dynamically assigned public IPs (`203.0.113.10`, `203.0.113.11`).

### **Clarifications**

- **SNAT vs. Static NAT**:
   - **SNAT**: Modifies the source address in packets.
   - **Static NAT**: One-to-one, permanent mapping of internal to external IP.

- **DNAT vs. Dynamic NAT**:
   - **DNAT**: Modifies the destination address in packets.
   - **Dynamic NAT**: Dynamically maps private IPs to a pool of public IPs, not necessarily involving destination address changes.

### **Key Differences**

|Feature|SNAT (Source NAT)|DNAT (Destination NAT)|Static NAT|Dynamic NAT|
|---|---|---|---|---|

|**Type**|One-to-many or many-to-one|Many-to-one or one-to-one|One-to-one|Many-to-many or many-to-one|
|**Use Case**|Outbound traffic|Inbound traffic|Hosting servers|Internet access sharing|
|**Consistency**|Can be dynamic|Can be dynamic|Fixed mapping|Dynamic mapping|
